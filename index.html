        <h3>Indian political class is still rooted to the ground </h3>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> August 12, 2024</p>
        <p> indian politicians are very rooted to the ground. they're the embodiment of people who elect them. It's obvious in their educational and criminal background.The disfunction in parliament echoes the societal dysfunction about arguments and dissent and creating ruckus to stop your opponent from speaking, Or shouting uncannily to prevent the opposite voice from being heard. MPs and MLAs lie much like we do. So only when people become truthful,respectful and tolreant of dissent is household,classroom,workspace can we expect a civilised and meaningful debate in our legislatures. because going by the voting pattern in 2024 polls, it's obvious that people carry no importance to debate and dissent in parliament. The same people rewarded the same people for doing not so great by reelevting them to do it again. Let us be the change
